If you've found this code, then you probably know me on a personal level. (or found the db)

To those who havent figured it out yet, yes, I'm trans. And I've been trans for a while now. So probably the only people that would still be surprised are my teachers and relatives. So hi my new names Seph hope you can deal with it, uh.

I keep this website for strangers on the internet to know me, and strangers on the internet see me for who I am. This is my safe space, my space, where I can be who and what I want to be.
